            Plato costs less than a cup of coffee, but can give you short-term
            and long-term brain benefits.

            When taking Plato consistently, many people notice increased focus,
            energy, and relaxation within the first few servings. And it only
            gets better with time, which is why we recommend that you use Plato
            every day.

          <p className="cheap-text text-lg  m-auto mb-4" data-aos="fade-right">
            Plato is well-tolerated, non-toxic, non-habit-forming and does not
            need to be cycled.

            Itâ€™s one of the safest, easiest additions to your routine that you
            can invest in, and can help you get to a baseline of calm and
            clarity so you can tackle life head on.
